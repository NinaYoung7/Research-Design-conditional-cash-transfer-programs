Submitted by: **NING YANG**

Time spent: **35** hours spent in total

This project is a part of Course APANPS5300 - RESEARCH DESIGN in Columbia University.


## Description

We study the way in which two different payment structures of the conditional cash transfer program influence and impact school attendance by low-income children in Bogota, Colombia. We base this research on the two predominant payment mechanisms used in the CCT programs: rolling out the cash transfers before and after compliance verification. We seek to prove that transferring the conditional cash after compliance with the program has been verified, increases secondary school attendance, and improves educational outcomes of low-income children in Colombia.

### Problem Statement 
Conditional Cash Transfers have been proven to increase educational outcomes in third-world countries throughout the Latin American region, primarily Colombia and Mexico. However, there has been little to no attention shed on how the different payment structures of these programs influence and impact their outcome.

### Study Objectives 
The following research seeks to determine the way in which different payment structures influence and impact the outcome of conditional cash transfer programs in Bogota, Colombia. - Provide insights to government officials regarding specific payment structures on the conditional cash transfer programs, showcasing opportunities for improvement that might lead to a higher program success rate.

### Research Design 
To carry out this research 600 low-income students were selected from 10 random high schools in Bogotá, Colombia. Their families voluntarily consented to participate. The researchers controlled for confounding variables such as gender, income level, children per household, and residential area. Students were divided equally into control and treatment groups, receiving the conditional cash transfers before and after compliance verification respectively. They would be monitored during the duration of the program to ensure their compliance with the program’s rules and expectations. Data of the beneficiary students was obtained from the secondary schools in Colombia, and local government agencies.

The measurement of the student’s attendance was done by calculating the average attendance rate during the duration of the program, and then performing a difference in proportions test to understand if this is statistically significantly higher for students who receive the conditional cash transfer after compliance verification, than those students who receive it before


## Summary

This project, which I completed in my first semester, left a lot to be desired. But it was the first time I applied my statistical knowledge to practice and completed the whole process from data collection to effect simulation. It was also the first time I used **R** for designing experiments. I approached problems as methodological thinkers and  assess whether the organization is asking the right questions, choosing a relevant design, gathering appropriate and meaningful evidence, and using the appropriate statistical analysis to answer those questions. Finally, I believe this experience can be applied to a real world problem or choice faced by my future organization.
